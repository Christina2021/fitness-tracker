## Description
Fitness Tracker is an app for a user to create and track their workouts daily.  A new workout may be created for the day, and multiple exercises may be added to the workout.  If a workout was already created for the day, the user may continue the workout to add more exercises.  The Dashboard will show the stats of the past 7 workouts for the user.
